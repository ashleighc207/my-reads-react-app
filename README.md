## Description
This is a simple React app that allows users to organize and track their books. _Note: starter code was provided. See commits for my work_

## How to Launch the App

- Install dependencies with `npm install` OR your favorite package manager's equivalent

## Dependencies

## How to Use the App
With the app open, you have three columns - want to read, currently reading, and read. You can sort books among these three categories - as well as remove them - using the green arrow located on the bottom right of each book. You can also search for new books to add to one of these lists using the search bar at the top.
